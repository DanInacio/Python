"People who bought also bought"

Can also be used for movie recommendations
"People who liked Movie 1 may also like Movie 2"


SUPPORT: default popularity of an item
support = (number of users who watched M) / (number of users)

CONFIDENCE: likelihood of association that an item B is also bought if item A is bought
confidence = (number of users who watched M1 and M2) / (number of users who watched M1)

LIFT: increase in the ratio of sale of B when A is sold
confidence/support

METHOD
1. Set a minimum support and confidence
2. Take all subsets with higher support than minimum support
3. Take all subsets with higher confidence than minimum confidence
4. Sort by decreasing lift


Eclat is the same except there is no confidence or lift. ONLY SUPPORT VALUES!

METHOD
